# Astro Data Loading Examples - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an Astro-based web application that demonstrates various data loading techniques using external APIs. It serves as an educational resource for developers learning how to integrate and display data from different sources in an Astro project.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Home Page

- Displays a grid of cards linking to different data loading examples
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### 2.2 Navigation

- Consistent navigation bar across all pages
- Responsive menu for mobile devices

### 2.3 Data Loading Examples

- Countries: Fetches and displays information about countries
- Jokes: Retrieves and shows a list of jokes
- Posts: Demonstrates loading placeholder post data
- Random Users: Fetches and displays information about random users

### 2.4 Loading Spinner

- Shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched on Countries page

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Framework and Libraries

- Astro as the main framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type-safe development

### 3.2 Data Loaders

- Implement separate loader functions for each data source

## 5. Performance Considerations

- Optimize images and assets for fast loading
- Implement lazy loading for images where appropriate
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in components

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Create and publish a custom loader as an NPM package
- Implement more complex data transformation within loaders
- Demonstrate integration with various CMSs and databases

## 7. Development Workflow

- Use npm for package management
- Implement proper TypeScript configurations for type checking
- Follow Astro's best practices for project structure and component organization

## 8. Deployment

- Build the project using Astro's production build process
- Deploy to a static hosting platform of choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)

This PRD provides an overview of the Astro Data Loading Examples project, outlining its key features, technical requirements, and considerations for future development. It serves as a guide for developers working on or extending this project.
